# Obstacle-Avoiding_Robot-Using-Servo-Motor
This robot uses an ESP32, a servo motor, and a single ultrasonic sensor to detect and avoid obstacles. The servo rotates the sensor to scan directions (left, center, right), and the ESP32 controls the robot's movement based on the distance readings to avoid collisions.
